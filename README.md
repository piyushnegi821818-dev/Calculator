# 🧮 Python Calculator Program 🚀

Welcome to the **Python Calculator Program**! This program allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let's make calculating easier! ✨

## 📋 Features:
- **Addition (+)** ➕
- **Subtraction (-)** ➖
- **Multiplication (*)** ✖️
- **Division (/) (with error handling for division by zero)** 🔢

## 🛠️ How to Use:
1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine or copy the code.
2. Run the Python script in your terminal/IDE.
3. Use the `calculator(a, b, operator)` function where:
    - `a` and `b` are the numbers you want to operate on.
    - `operator` is one of the following: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.

Example usage:
```python
calculator(100, 100, "/")  # Output: 1.0
calculator(50, 5, "+")     # Output: 55
